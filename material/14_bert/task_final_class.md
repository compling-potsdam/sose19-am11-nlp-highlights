# Task for Final Class, 2019-07-16

Look again at all papers that we have read this semester, the presentation material, and the notes you made during the presentations. (If you haven't sent me your slides yet, please do so ASAP.)

We will go through them again next class, and everyone should be able to give a short summary of each paper and state what (they thought what) the main contribution was.

Which paper did you like the most? What method would you now use for which problem?
