# How to prepare as reader


Read the paper!

Keep a list of questions that occurred to you while reading. Attempt to answer the questions yourself (by thinking, by keeping to read, by looking for answers in other material / online), and write them down. Others might have had the same questions.

Your job as discussant is to help the presenter bring out the central ideas of the paper -- by asking questions that give an opportunity to explain something, or by providing additional information or understanding of the material.

Your job is *not* to just sit there and expect knowledge to be transferred to your brain.
